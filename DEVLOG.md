# Wunderland Sol — Development Diary

> Autonomous development log maintained by Claude Opus (AI Agent)
> Colosseum Agent Hackathon — February 2-12, 2026

---

## Entry 1 — Project Inception
**Date**: 2026-02-04 05:41 UTC
**Agent**: Claude Opus 4.5 (`claude-opus-4-5-20251101`)
**Action**: Hackathon registration + project scaffolding

### Decisions Made Autonomously

1. **Registered as `wunderland-sol`** on Colosseum Agent Hackathon (Agent ID: 433)
2. **Chose new repo strategy** — separate `wunderland-sol` repo for clean judge evaluation, with existing AgentOS/Wunderland packages as conceptual dependencies
3. **Selected holographic cyberpunk aesthetic** — distinctive visual identity to stand apart from generic hackathon UIs
4. **Chose Anchor framework** for custom Solana program over simpler web3.js-only approach — more technically impressive for judges
5. **Designed PDA architecture**:
   - AgentIdentity: HEXACO personality traits stored on-chain (unique primitive)
   - PostAnchor: Content hashes with InputManifest provenance
   - ReputationVote: Community-driven reputation scoring

### Architecture Rationale

The key differentiator from ZNAP and other "social network for AI agents" projects is the **HEXACO personality model on-chain**. No other project stores a scientifically-validated 6-factor personality model as on-chain account data. Combined with cryptographic provenance (InputManifest proving each post was stimulus-driven, not human-prompted), this creates a verifiable social intelligence layer on Solana.

### Human Configuration (Allowed Per Rules)
- Human provided: Solana RPC endpoints (Helius), wallet credentials, high-level project direction
- Agent performs: All code writing, architectural decisions, testing, deployment, forum engagement

### Next Steps
- Install Rust + Anchor + Solana CLI
- Scaffold Anchor program with account structures
- Begin TypeScript SDK
- Create Colosseum project draft

---

## Entry 2 — Infrastructure & Orchestrator Setup
**Date**: 2026-02-04 06:00 UTC
**Agent**: Claude Opus 4.5

### Completed
- Registered on Colosseum (Agent ID: 433, Project ID: 203)
- Created GitHub repo: https://github.com/manicinc/wunderland-sol
- Installed Rust 1.93.0, Solana CLI and Anchor installing in background
- Built SDK types + client (PDA derivation, account decoding)
- Created SynInt Framework orchestrator prompt
- Created multi-agent dev-loop.sh script
- Renamed project to "WUNDERLAND ON SOL"

### Lesson Learned
Posted on Colosseum forum prematurely before project had substance. Future forum posts should only happen after features are working.

## Entry 3 — Frontend + Anchor Program Complete
**Date**: 2026-02-04 07:30 UTC
**Agent**: Claude Opus 4.5

### Completed
- **Next.js frontend**: 7 pages building successfully (landing, agents, agent profile, feed, leaderboard, network)
- **Holographic cyberpunk design system**: Custom CSS with glassmorphism, holo cards, neon glow, scan lines
- **HexacoRadar component**: Animated SVG radar chart — the visual signature
- **API routes**: `/api/agents`, `/api/posts`, `/api/leaderboard`, `/api/stats`
- **Anchor program (Rust)**: Compiled successfully to SBF
  - Program ID: `ExSiNgfPTSPew6kCqetyNcw8zWMo1hozULkZR1CSEq88`
  - 3 account types: AgentIdentity, PostAnchor, ReputationVote
  - 5 instructions: initialize_agent, anchor_post, cast_vote, update_agent_level, deactivate_agent
- **Orchestrator agent**: TypeScript + shell scripts for autonomous dev loops
- **Demo data**: 6 agents, 8 posts with provenance hashes

### Technical Challenges
1. **Anchor toolchain + edition2024**: `constant_time_eq v0.4.2` requires Rust edition 2024 but Solana platform tools ship with Cargo 1.79.0. Fixed by pinning `blake3` to v1.5.5 in Cargo.lock and using `cargo build-sbf` directly with system Rust.
2. **Disk space**: Multiple Solana release downloads consumed available space. Cleaned old releases to free 1.2GB.

### Architecture Status
- Frontend: ✅ All pages rendering, build passing
- Anchor program: ✅ Compiled, keypair generated
- On-chain deployment: ⏳ Pending (devnet)
- CI/CD: ✅ GitHub Actions workflow for Linode deployment
- Local deploy: ✅ Verified on solana-test-validator

---

## Entry 4 — CI/CD + Local Deploy Verification
**Date**: 2026-02-04
**Agent**: Claude Opus 4.5

### Completed
- **GitHub Actions CI/CD**: Created `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` for automated Linode deployment
  - Two-stage: build (pnpm + Next.js) → deploy (SSH + SCP to Linode)
  - Nginx reverse proxy + systemd service auto-configured
  - Uses GitHub Secrets: `LINODE_HOST`, `LINODE_PASSWORD`
- **Local deploy verification**: Program deploys and runs on `solana-test-validator`
  - Program ID confirmed: `ExSiNgfPTSPew6kCqetyNcw8zWMo1hozULkZR1CSEq88`
  - Signature: `3MWTgusdEM3uKJVWy5TaR172yDokbFU15vB3gpJJG1NUbbujG8yCzbUePurkjKe977t8F2iSncF1M7cs3k8cJ9E1`
- **Repo verified public**: https://github.com/manicinc/wunderland-sol

### Blockers
- **Devnet airdrop rate-limited**: Solana devnet faucet returning 429. Need manual airdrop via https://faucet.solana.com (requires GitHub OAuth in browser). Wallet: `65xUZajxCNsHxU32zG8zvQDCD19778DJRDd6fvCuH3kB`
- **Linode not yet created**: User needs to provision Linode instance and add IP to GitHub Secrets

### Next Steps
- Get devnet SOL → deploy program to devnet
- Seed demo agents + posts on devnet
- Create Linode → add secrets → trigger CI/CD deploy

---

## Entry 5 — Devnet Deploy + Data Layer Refactor
**Date**: 2026-02-04
**Agent**: Claude Opus 4.5

### Completed
- **Anchor program live on Solana devnet**
  - Program ID: `ExSiNgfPTSPew6kCqetyNcw8zWMo1hozULkZR1CSEq88`
  - Deploy signature: `2dBgsfdrUWN9f7C15kkVuYho3XeeUmsYgpfdLqCNCnymuGfyNim8EmT1PpS17ZB83LQDMKmueQAGKUyoq7kD8rue`
  - Cost: ~1.78 SOL (from 2 SOL airdrop)
- **Data layer centralized**: Created `app/src/lib/solana.ts` as unified SDK bridge
  - Demo mode (current): single source of truth via `demo-data.ts`
  - On-chain mode: switchable via `NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLANA_RPC` env var
  - Eliminated 4x data duplication across pages
- **All pages refactored**: landing, agents, feed, leaderboard now import from `solana.ts`
- **API routes refactored**: all 4 routes now use `solana.ts` bridge
- **Build verified**: 12 routes compiling (7 pages + 4 API + 1 not-found)

### Architecture
```
demo-data.ts (raw data)
    ↓
solana.ts (bridge: demo mode → on-chain mode)
    ↓
pages + API routes (consumers)
```

When `NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLANA_RPC` is set, `solana.ts` will switch from demo data to real on-chain reads via `WunderlandSolClient` from the SDK package.

### Next Steps
- Seed demo agents on devnet
- Provision Linode + add GitHub Secrets
- Wire wallet adapter for browser-side transactions

## Entry 6 — Deploy Pipeline Fixes + SSL + DNS
**Date**: 2026-02-04
**Agent**: Claude Opus 4.5

### Problem
First Linode deployment resulted in **502 Bad Gateway**. Root cause was a cascade of issues in the CI/CD pipeline related to pnpm's strict symlink isolation and the SCP transfer method.

### Bugs Found & Fixed (8 commits)

1. **`styled-jsx` not found in standalone output**: pnpm symlink isolation prevents Next.js file tracing from finding transitive deps. Fixed by adding `styled-jsx: "5.1.6"` as direct dependency in `app/package.json` and setting `outputFileTracingRoot` in `next.config.ts`.

2. **`@swc/helpers` missing**: Same root cause. Fixed by using `pnpm install --node-linker=hoisted` in CI only — creates flat `node_modules/` that Next.js file tracing can follow. Local dev keeps default pnpm symlinks.

3. **Empty `app/public` dir**: Not tracked by git, caused `cp` failure in CI. Added `.gitkeep` and made copy conditional (`2>/dev/null || true`).

4. **Hoisted `node_modules` path mismatch**: Verification step looked for `deploy/app/node_modules/next/` but hoisted layout puts it at `deploy/node_modules/next/`. Fixed path checks.

5. **Wrong `WorkingDirectory` in systemd**: Next.js standalone `server.js` looks for `.next/` relative to `process.cwd()`. WorkingDirectory was `/opt/wunderland-sol` but `.next/` lives at `/opt/wunderland-sol/app/.next/`. Fixed to `WorkingDirectory=/opt/wunderland-sol/app` with `ExecStart=node server.js`.

6. **`.next` dot-directory silently dropped by `appleboy/scp-action`**: Most insidious bug — build artifacts verified correct in CI, but the SCP action just didn't transfer dot-directories. Replaced entire transfer method with manual `tar czf` + `scp` + `tar xzf` approach.

7. **Merged two-job workflow into single job**: Eliminated artifact passing overhead, simplified deploy pipeline.

### CI/CD Pipeline (Final)
```
pnpm install --node-linker=hoisted
  → next build (standalone)
  → tar czf (preserves dot-dirs)
  → scp tarball to Linode
  → tar xzf + systemd + nginx
```

### Linode Infrastructure
- **Server**: Ubuntu 24.04, 4GB, Atlanta, `50.116.35.110`
- **Nginx**: Reverse proxy on ports 80 + 443 → Node.js on 3000
- **SSL**: Self-signed cert for Cloudflare "Full" mode
- **systemd**: `wunderland-sol.service` with auto-restart

### Cloudflare DNS Setup
- Domain: `wunderland.sh`
- A records: `@`, `www`, `sol` → `50.116.35.110` (Proxied)
- SSL mode: Full (self-signed cert on origin)

### Result
- GitHub Actions run **#21663340842**: ALL GREEN
- HTTP 200 confirmed on `50.116.35.110`
- Site live at `wunderland.sh` via Cloudflare proxy

### Documentation Added
- `ONCHAIN_ARCHITECTURE.md`: Comprehensive on-chain reference (PDAs, instructions, error codes, SDK usage)
- `scripts/interact.ts`: Full contract interaction/verification script for all 5 instructions

### Next Steps
- Redeploy Anchor program to fix `DeclaredProgramIdMismatch` (needs ~1.8 SOL)
- Seed demo agents on devnet
- Wire wallet adapter for browser-side transactions
- Forum engagement on Colosseum

## Entry 7 — SDK Write Methods + Visual Identity Overhaul
**Date**: 2026-02-04
**Commits**: `458d551`, `3f8df06`, `30cc5bd`, `121f5b1`
**Agent**: Claude Opus 4.5

### Completed

**SDK write methods** (`30cc5bd`):
- Added all 5 write methods to `WunderlandSolClient`: `registerAgent`, `anchorPost`, `castVote`, `updateAgentLevel`, `deactivateAgent`
- Each builds raw `TransactionInstruction` with manual Anchor discriminator encoding (SHA-256 of `global:{method_name}`, first 8 bytes)
- Validates HEXACO trait ranges (0-1) and display name constraints
- `anchorPost` reads current `total_posts` from on-chain agent account to derive correct PostAnchor PDA

**Visual identity system** (`121f5b1`):
- Created `ProceduralAvatar` component — generates unique geometric SVG patterns from HEXACO trait values (polygon sides from conscientiousness, hue from dominant trait, layers from openness)
- Created `ParticleBackground` — canvas-based floating particles with Solana purple/green colors and connection lines between nearby particles
- Enhanced `globals.css` with new animations: shimmer-text, float, verified-pulse, stat-value glow, gradient-border, nav-link hover underline
- Added procedural avatars to agents directory, feed, and leaderboard pages

**Infrastructure** (`458d551`, `3f8df06`):
- Added SSL (self-signed cert) to Nginx config in CI/CD workflow
- Streamlined orchestrator prompt — removed 780 lines of redundant dev loop scripts, consolidated to 47-line focused prompt

### Design Philosophy
The procedural avatar is derived deterministically from personality traits — agents with similar HEXACO profiles will have similar visual signatures, while extreme profiles produce distinctive geometric patterns. This reinforces the core concept: personality is the primitive.

## Entry 8 — Dynamic Hero, Richer Demo Agents, HEXACO Explainer
**Date**: 2026-02-04
**Commit**: `b1d31bb`
**Agent**: Claude Opus 4.5

### Completed

**Demo data overhaul** — Rewrote `demo-data.ts` from scratch:
- 8 agents (up from 6) with dramatically varied HEXACO profiles, not generic balanced presets
- Each agent has: detailed bio, full system prompt, model name, tags, on-chain post count
- Agents designed as distinct characters: Cipher (C=0.98 formal verifier), Nova (O=0.98/C=0.20 wildcard), Echo (E=0.95 empath), Vertex (X=0.95/A=0.20 contrarian), etc.
- 20+ posts with personality-consistent voices and cross-agent references
- Added new fields to Agent interface: `bio`, `systemPrompt`, `onChainPosts`, `model`, `tags`

**Dynamic landing page** — Complete rewrite of `page.tsx`:
- `MorphingHero`: HEXACO radar cycles through agents every 4s with orbiting clickable ProceduralAvatar buttons
- `TypingText`: Typing animation cycling through 5 taglines with cursor blink
- `AnimatedCounter`: Ease-out cubic animated stat counters
- `HexacoExplainer`: Interactive section — hover a trait to see the radar reshape, showing how each dimension affects agent personality
- "How It Works" section explaining Identity → Provenance → Reputation flow with PDA seed examples

**Agent profile page** — Enhanced with:
- Expandable System Prompt panel (shows exact prompt used for AI generation)
- Expandable Seed Data panel (trait vector in on-chain format, PDA seeds, post count, model, registration date)
- Dominant/weakest trait indicators (MAX/MIN labels on HEXACO bars)
- Tags, model name, on-chain post count with cluster label

**OrganicButton v1** — Custom CTA buttons with animated SVG undulating membrane border. Added for GitHub source link and Colosseum hackathon link.

**Environment config** — Added `.env.example` documenting `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLUSTER=devnet|mainnet-beta` for devnet/mainnet switching.

### Feedback Received
User tested the build and flagged:
- OrganicButton SVG undulation felt "gimmicky" — needs redesign
- "Enter the Network" CTA should match the organic button style
- Hardcoded stats (8 agents, 100% on-chain) are misleading when nothing is actually live on-chain
- Agents need visible IDs (PDA addresses) on cards

---

## Entry 9 — Wallet Adapter, Minting UI, Honest Metrics
**Date**: 2026-02-04
**Commit**: `c2d6726`
**Agent**: Claude Opus 4.5

### Completed

**OrganicButton v2** — Redesigned from SVG undulation to pure CSS:
- Rotating conic gradient border via `@property --btn-angle` CSS Houdini
- Glass fill with backdrop blur
- Hover: border opacity increase + colored box-shadow glow
- All 3 landing CTAs now use OrganicButton (Enter the Network, View Source, Colosseum)

**Honest placeholder stats**:
- Stats section now shows "(demo)" suffix when not in on-chain mode
- "Network" card shows "Demo" instead of pretending it's on-chain
- Agent directory badge: "Demo" instead of "On-Chain" when in demo mode
- Section heading changed from "Active Agents" to "Agent Directory (demo)"

**Agent IDs on cards**:
- All agent cards now show truncated PDA address (`xxxx...xxxx`) in monospace
- Agents directory already showed full address — kept as-is

**Wallet adapter integration**:
- Installed `@solana/wallet-adapter-react`, `@solana/wallet-adapter-react-ui`, `@solana/wallet-adapter-wallets`, `@coral-xyz/anchor`
- Created `SolanaWalletProvider` (ConnectionProvider → WalletProvider → WalletModalProvider)
- Created `WalletButton` (dynamic import of WalletMultiButton, styled to match cyberpunk theme)
- Created `AppShell` client wrapper — extracted nav + footer from server layout, wraps in wallet provider
- Layout.tsx simplified to server component with metadata + AppShell
- Supports Phantom + Solflare wallets, auto-connect enabled

**Agent minting page** (`/mint`):
- Wallet connection gate (shows prompt to connect if no wallet)
- Existing agent detection (checks if PDA already exists for connected wallet)
- Display name input (32 char max, validated)
- 6 HEXACO trait sliders (0-100%) with color indicators and descriptions
- Live preview panel: HexacoRadar + ProceduralAvatar update in real-time as sliders move
- On-chain vector preview: shows `[u16; 6]` values that will be stored
- Submit builds raw transaction via `solana-client.ts`, signs with wallet adapter
- Success state shows Solana Explorer link + agent profile link

**Browser-side Solana client** (`solana-client.ts`):
- Uses Web Crypto API for Anchor discriminator computation (no Node.js `crypto`)
- `buildMintAgentTx`: Constructs `initialize_agent` instruction with PDA derivation
- `buildCastVoteTx`: Constructs `cast_vote` instruction (added by linter)
- `agentExists`: Checks if agent PDA account exists on-chain
- All functions return unsigned `Transaction` for wallet adapter signing

**Anchor program improvements**:
- Added overflow error variants: `PostCountOverflow`, `VoteCountOverflow`, `ReputationOverflow`
- Added checked arithmetic to `anchor_post` and `cast_vote` instructions

**Feed page enhanced** (by linter):
- Vote buttons now use wallet adapter for on-chain voting when in on-chain mode
- Shows error messages for vote failures
- Tracks on-chain votes per post to prevent double-voting

### Build Verification
- `pnpm build`: 13 routes compiled successfully (0 errors)
- All pages HTTP 200 on production server (port 3001)
- New `/mint` page rendering correctly

### Architecture After This Entry
```
Browser (wallet adapter)
  → solana-client.ts (builds raw tx)
  → Phantom/Solflare (signs)
  → Solana RPC (submits)

Server (API routes)
  → solana-server.ts (reads on-chain data)
  → solana.ts (demo fallback)
  → demo-data.ts (seed data)
```

### Next Steps
- Deploy to Vercel or Linode with updated build
- Get devnet SOL for testing minting flow end-to-end
- Redeploy Anchor program (fix DeclaredProgramIdMismatch)
- Forum engagement on Colosseum
- Dev diary automation (this entry was backfilled)

## Entry 8 — Phase 3: SOL-Tipped Content Injection System
**Date**: 2026-02-04 17:30 UTC
**Agent**: Claude Opus 4.5

### Overview
Implemented the complete SOL-tipped content injection system — users can pay 0.01-0.05 SOL to inject content (text or URL snapshots) into the agent stimulus feed. This is a monetization primitive that transforms passive reading into active participation while maintaining cryptographic verifiability.

### On-Chain Program Updates (`anchor/programs/wunderland_sol/`)

**New Account Types** (`state.rs`):
- `Enclave` — Topic spaces (renamed from "subreddits" for better branding)
- `TipAnchor` — Content hash, amount, priority, status tracking
- `TipEscrow` — Holds funds until settlement/refund
- `TipperRateLimit` — Per-wallet rate limits (3/min, 20/hour)
- `GlobalTreasury` — Collects 70% of settled tips

**New Instructions**:
- `create_enclave` — Create topic space (creator receives 30% of targeted tips)
- `initialize_treasury` — One-time treasury setup
- `submit_tip` — Submit tip with escrow, derives priority on-chain from amount
- `settle_tip` — 70/30 split (treasury/creator) or 100% for global tips
- `refund_tip` — Full refund on processing failure
- `claim_timeout_refund` — Self-service refund after 30 min timeout

**Security Decisions**:
1. **Priority derived on-chain** — Can't be spoofed by user input
2. **creator_authority enforced from agent identity** — Prevents payout hijacking
3. **Escrow-based settlement** — Can't split then refund (was a bug in original plan)
4. **Status enum instead of bool** — `status: u8` (pending/settled/refunded) for indexer flexibility
5. **Per-wallet nonce** — `["tip", tipper, tip_nonce]` avoids global contention

### Backend Package Updates (`packages/wunderland/src/social/`)

**Rename: subreddits → enclaves**:
- `SubredditRegistry.ts` → `EnclaveRegistry.ts` (with deprecated aliases)
- Updated `BrowsingEngine.ts`, `WonderlandNetwork.ts`, `NewsFeedIngester.ts`, `types.ts`
- All 21 BrowsingEngine tests + 42 EnclaveRegistry tests pass

**New: ContentSanitizer** (`ContentSanitizer.ts`):
- SSRF-safe URL fetching with private IP blocking (RFC1918, localhost, cloud metadata)
- Content-type allowlisting (text/html, application/json, etc.)
- HTML sanitization (removes scripts, iframes, event handlers)
- Size/timeout limits (1MB, 10s)
- 37 unit tests pass

**New: IpfsPinner** (`IpfsPinner.ts`):
- Raw block pinning (CID = bafkrei + base32(sha256(content)))
- Supports local IPFS, Pinata, web3.storage, NFT.storage
- Static methods: `cidFromHash()`, `verifyCid()`, `computeCid()`
- CID derivable from on-chain content_hash for verifiable provenance
- 23 unit tests pass

**New: TipIngester** (`TipIngester.ts`):
- Processes on-chain tips: sanitize → verify hash → pin IPFS → route to agents
- Settlement/refund callbacks for on-chain state transitions
- Preview API for UI validation before transaction

**Updated: Tip type** (`types.ts`):
- Added `TipPriorityLevel`, `priority`, `ipfsCid`, `contentHash`, `tipPda` fields

### Key Architecture Decision: Snapshot-Based URL Tips (Option A)
For URL tips, we commit to the **sanitized snapshot hash** (not the URL string). This means:
- User provides URL → backend fetches & sanitizes → computes hash → user commits hash on-chain
- Prevents bait-and-switch attacks (URL content changing after tip)
- IPFS CID is derivable: `bafkrei + base32(sha256(snapshot))`
- Trade-off: More complex flow, but cryptographically verifiable

### Build Status
- Anchor program: `cargo build` ✓ (25 warnings, 0 errors)
- Backend package: `pnpm build` ✓
- Tests: 123 new tests pass (ContentSanitizer: 37, IpfsPinner: 23, EnclaveRegistry: 42, BrowsingEngine: 21)

### Next Steps
- API routes for tips (`/api/tips/preview`, `/api/tips/submit`)
- Rename `/feed` → `/world` in Next.js app
- SDK client methods (`submitTip`, `settleTip`, `refundTip`)
- Deploy updated Anchor program to devnet

## Entry 9 — Brand Identity & Light/Dark Mode
**Date**: 2026-02-04 18:00 UTC
**Agent**: Claude Opus 4.5

### Overview
Integrated the official Wunderland brand identity and added light/dark mode toggle with an animated lantern icon. The brand system is designed for both dark (cyberpunk) and light (corporate) contexts.

### Brand Components Created (`app/src/components/brand/`)

**WunderlandIcon.tsx**:
- Hexagonal mirror frame with "W" reflected across a shimmer line
- Three variants: `neon` (electric blue → gold), `gold` (heritage gold), `monochrome`
- Art deco gold corner accents
- SVG-based with unique gradient IDs to avoid conflicts

**WunderlandLogo.tsx**:
- Typography-based logo using Syne 700 for "WUNDERLAND"
- Variants: `full` (icon + text + tagline), `compact`, `icon`, `wordmark`
- Sizes: `sm` (32px icon), `md` (48px), `lg` (64px)
- Optional "RABBIT HOLE INC" parent badge

### Theme System

**LanternToggle.tsx**:
- Animated SVG lantern with flickering flame
- Glows in dark mode, dims in light mode
- Persists preference to localStorage (`wl-theme`)

**ThemeProvider.tsx**:
- React context for theme state
- Respects system preference on first visit
- SSR-safe (returns defaults during prerender)

### Style Updates (`app/src/styles/globals.css`)

**New CSS Variables**:
- `--wl-blue`, `--wl-blue-light`, `--wl-gold`, `--wl-shimmer`
- `.wl-gradient-text`, `.wl-shimmer-text` utility classes

**Light Mode Overrides**:
- Full override set for `.glass`, `.holo-card`, scrollbars, badges
- Noise texture reduced to 1.5% opacity
- Gradient text brightness adjusted

### Files Added
- `app/public/icon.svg` — Scalable favicon
- `app/public/manifest.json` — PWA manifest with theme color
- `app/src/app/about/page.tsx` — Brand showcase page

### Build Status
- Next.js build: ✓ (20 routes generated)
- No type errors
- Light/dark toggle functional

### Parent Platform: Rabbit Hole Inc
The Wunderland platform is now branded as a subsidiary of "Rabbit Hole Inc" — the human-AI collaboration platform. The gold keyhole icon and champagne color scheme connect the two brands while maintaining Wunderland's cyberpunk identity.

## Entry 10 — Real-Time Stimulus Feed with SQLite Storage
**Date**: 2026-02-04 20:30 UTC
**Agent**: Claude Opus 4.5

### Overview
Implemented a real-time stimulus feed that polls external news sources (HackerNews, arXiv) and stores them locally in SQLite. This replaces the hardcoded demo data with live, configurable data ingestion.

### Design Decision: Local SQLite vs IPFS
User feedback: "Keep that data stored in SQLite locally on the server since we don't need that to be decentralized."

Rationale:
- News feed data is ephemeral and high-volume
- No need for cryptographic provenance (unlike user-submitted tips)
- SQLite provides fast queries and simple deployment
- IPFS reserved for tip content where verifiable provenance matters

### New Files Created

**`app/src/lib/db/stimulus-db.ts`**:
- SQLite schema using better-sqlite3
- Tables: `stimulus_items`, `ingestion_state`, `stimulus_config`
- Content-hash based deduplication
- Runtime-configurable settings stored in DB
- Key types: `StimulusItem`, `StimulusQuery`

**`app/src/lib/db/stimulus-ingester.ts`**:
- HackerNews ingestion via Algolia API (no auth required)
- arXiv ingestion via Atom feed (no auth required)
- Priority derivation from HN points (>500=breaking, >200=high, >100=normal, else low)
- Category extraction from tags and title keywords
- Parallel polling with `Promise.all`

**`app/src/app/api/stimulus/feed/route.ts`**:
- GET endpoint with pagination and filtering
- Query params: `limit`, `offset`, `type`, `source`, `priority`, `since`

**`app/src/app/api/stimulus/poll/route.ts`**:
- POST to trigger manual poll (for cron jobs)
- GET for polling status and statistics

**`app/src/app/api/stimulus/config/route.ts`**:
- GET/POST for runtime configuration
- Validates poll intervals (60s–24hr), boolean flags, item limits

### Configuration (`.env.example`)
```
STIMULUS_POLL_INTERVAL_MS=900000    # 15 min default
STIMULUS_DB_PATH=                   # Default: ./data
STIMULUS_HACKERNEWS_ENABLED=true
STIMULUS_ARXIV_ENABLED=true
STIMULUS_MAX_ITEMS_PER_POLL=25
```

### UI Updates (`app/src/app/world/page.tsx`)

**StimulusFeed component now**:
- Fetches from `/api/stimulus/feed?limit=15`
- Displays source badges: HN (orange), arXiv (red), TIP (purple)
- Shows priority badges with color coding
- Relative time formatting ("2h ago", "just now")
- Clickable titles for URL items
- HN metadata (points, comments)
- Categories as small tags
- Scrollable container with max height

### Backend Service Status
**Currently**: Polling is on-demand only. Call `POST /api/stimulus/poll` to trigger.

**Production options**:
1. External cron job hitting the poll endpoint
2. Vercel/Railway cron (if deploying there)
3. Next.js instrumentation for server-side background task
4. NestJS scheduled task calling the Next.js API

The Next.js app doesn't run a persistent background loop—that would require either instrumentation or a separate service.

### Build Status
- Next.js build: ✓ (23 routes)
- SDK build: ✓
- No type errors

### Next Steps
- ~~Set up cron job for automatic polling~~ → Done (Entry 11)
- Add WebSocket/SSE for real-time feed updates
- Agent mood reactions to incoming stimulus

---

## Entry 11 — Background Stimulus Polling + NestJS Migration + RabbitHole Refactor
**Date**: 2026-02-04
**Agent**: Claude Opus 4.5

### Background Stimulus Polling (`instrumentation.ts`)

Implemented automatic stimulus feed polling using Next.js 15's instrumentation API — no cron jobs or external services needed.

**How it works**:
- `app/src/instrumentation.ts` exports a `register()` function
- Next.js calls this once on server startup (Node.js runtime only)
- Initial poll fires after 5s delay, then recurring at configured interval (default 15min)
- Uses `STIMULUS_POLL_INTERVAL_MS` env var for customization

```typescript

### NestJS Backend Architecture Migration

Major backend restructure from flat Express routes to NestJS modular architecture:

**New modules** (13 total):
- `WunderlandModule` — conditionally loaded parent module with sub-modules:
  - `AgentRegistryModule` — agent identity + provenance
  - `SocialFeedModule` — posts, threads, engagement
  - `WorldFeedModule` — RSS/API stimulus ingestion
  - `StimulusModule` — manual/automated stimulus injection
  - `ApprovalQueueModule` — HITL review queue
  - `CitizensModule` — public profiles + leaderboard
  - `VotingModule` — governance proposals + voting
- `WunderlandGateway` — Socket.IO WebSocket for real-time events
- Auth guards: `JwtAuthGuard`, `OptionalAuthGuard`, `WsAuthGuard`

**WebSocket events** (server → client):
- `feed:new-post`, `feed:engagement`
- `approval:pending`, `approval:resolved`
- `voting:proposal-update`
- `agent:status`, `world-feed:new-item`

### RabbitHole Frontend Refactor

Migrated RabbitHole Next.js app from mock/demo data to live backend APIs:

**Key changes**:
- New `wunderland-api.ts` client library with typed API methods
- Admin dashboard (`/admin`) — live metrics from backend
- Approval queue (`/admin/queue`) — real approve/reject actions
- Wunderland pages use real API data instead of `demo-data.ts`
- Auth flow with `vcaAuthToken` in localStorage

### Packages Updated

- **rabbithole**: Admin TaskQueueManager, AnonymizationPolicy, shared UI component library
- **wunderland**: SeedNetworkManager, InputManifest, LevelingEngine, NewsroomAgency improvements
- **fullstack-evals-harness**: Built-in graders (answer-relevancy, context-relevancy, regex, json-schema), candidates schema, prompts module
