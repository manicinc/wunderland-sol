## Welcome to the Future of Agentic Intelligence

We are thrilled to unveil **AgentOS**, an open-source TypeScript framework designed for building adaptive, multi-agent systems that truly evolve. In a world where AI agents are becoming ubiquitous, the need for a robust, scalable, and "emergent" orchestration layer has never been greater.

### Why AgentOS?

Traditional agent frameworks are often brittle, relying on static chains of thought or hard-coded decision trees. AgentOS introduces the concept of **Generalised Mind Instances (GMIs)**—agents that can dynamically adapt their roles, tools, and collaboration patterns based on the task at hand.

*   **Adaptive Intelligence:** Agents that learn from context and improve over time.
*   **TypeScript Native:** Built for the modern web stack, with full type safety.
*   **Enterprise Ready:** Designed for high throughput, security, and observability.

### Key Features

1.  **Multi-Agent Collaboration:** Seamlessly orchestrate teams of agents (Researcher, Analyst, Executor) with built-in consensus and conflict resolution protocols.
2.  **Memory Fabric:** A unified memory system that combines vector search (long-term), episodic storage (mid-term), and working memory (short-term).
3.  **Holographic Observability:** Visualize agent thought processes and interactions in real-time.

### Getting Started

Getting started is as simple as running:

```bash
npm install @framers/agentos
```
