# AgentOS Site (agentos.sh)

Next.js + Tailwind marketing surface for the AgentOS runtime. This site is designed to live at `agentos.sh` and mirrors the Frame.dev aesthetic with light/dark theming, motion highlights, and roadmap callouts.

## Features

- App Router (Next 14) with server components + streaming-ready sections  
- Tailwind design system with utility helpers, glassmorphism treatment, and dark mode (`next-themes`)  
- Framer Motion animations on hero content  
- Lucide iconography and responsive layout tuned for product storytelling  
- Ready-to-link CTAs into GitHub, documentation, and marketing pipelines

## Commands

```bash
pnpm dev         # standard next dev server (no doc watcher)
pnpm dev:full    # next dev + TypeDoc watcher (doc search hot reload)
pnpm build       # regenerates docs, copies them to public/docs-generated, then next build
pnpm start       # serve production build
pnpm lint        # Next lint rules
pnpm typecheck   # TypeScript no-emit check
pnpm docs:watch  # (optional) run TypeDoc watcher without starting dev server
```

## Structure

- `app/page.tsx` – primary landing experience  
- `components/` – client-side helpers like the theme toggle provider  
- `tailwind.config.ts` – shared tokens (brand palette, glass shadow, etc.)

The landing site is intentionally decoupled from the proprietary Voice Chat Assistant frontend so it can be published or deployed independently.

## Documentation Search

The hero includes a documentation search trigger (keyboard `/` or `Ctrl/⌘ + K`). It reads the TypeDoc JSON index generated by the AgentOS package:

1. Run `pnpm dev:full` whenever you want live doc search; it launches `next dev` + the TypeDoc watcher so `public/docs/docs.json` stays fresh while you work.  
2. The bundle writes `apps/agentos.sh/public/docs/docs.json`; if it's missing you'll see a reminder banner instead of results.  
3. For non-interactive generation (CI, etc.) run `pnpm --filter @framers/agentos run docs` before `pnpm build`—the build script already does this automatically.

`components/docs/DocSearch.tsx` assumes docs live under `/docs`. Update `DOCS_BASE_PATH` in that file if you host documentation elsewhere.

## Media Assets

Some sections render optional media. When files are missing, a placeholder explaining the expected filename/path appears so you can deploy safely:

| Location | Expected path | Notes |
|----------|---------------|-------|
| Hero loop | `public/media/landing/voice-hero-loop.mp4` (+ optional `.webm`, `voice-hero-poster.jpg`) | Short 8–12 s clip highlighting the voice pipeline. |
| Architecture diagram | `public/media/diagrams/agentos-architecture-light.png` and `...-dark.png` | Used in the architecture overview; supply both themes for best results. |
| GMI layers diagram | `public/media/diagrams/gmi-layers-light.png` and `...-dark.png` | Illustrates how a GMI combines persona, memory, guardrails, and tools. |
| Voice pipeline diagram | `public/media/landing/voice-pipeline-light.svg` and `...-dark.svg` | Shows the capture → AgentOS → tool flow on the Voice Chat Assistant landing. |

If you prefer different names, adjust the `heroVideoSources` / `pipelineImageSources` constants in `app/page.tsx` (AgentOS) and `frontend/src/views/PublicHome.vue` (voice UI).
