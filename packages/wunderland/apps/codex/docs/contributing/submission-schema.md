# Frame Codex Submission Schema Reference

This document provides the complete technical specification for Frame Codex content schema, including integration with OpenStrand's Educational Content Atom (ECA) standard.

---

## Table of Contents

1. [Schema Overview](#schema-overview)
2. [Strand Schema (Individual Content)](#strand-schema)
3. [Loom Schema (Collections)](#loom-schema)
4. [Weave Schema (Universes)](#weave-schema)
5. [ECA Integration](#eca-integration)
6. [Validation Rules](#validation-rules)
7. [Examples](#examples)

---

## Schema Overview

Frame Codex uses a three-tier knowledge organization:

```
Weave (Universe)
├── Loom (Collection)
│   ├── Strand (Content)
│   ├── Strand (Content)
│   └── ...
├── Loom (Collection)
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

### Key Principles

- **Strands** are atomic, self-contained knowledge units
- **Looms** curate related strands into coherent learning paths
- **Weaves** represent complete, isolated knowledge universes
- **No cross-weave relationships** (each weave is independent)
- **Subfolders are SUBTOPICS** - folder depth determines topic specificity (deeper = more specific)
- **Topics are hierarchical** - must narrow scope as you go deeper in the folder tree
- **Tags are independent** - can be shared freely across any folder level

---

## Strand Schema

Strands are individual markdown files with YAML frontmatter.

### Required Fields

```yaml
id: string (UUID v4)
slug: string (lowercase, hyphens, alphanumeric)
title: string (3-100 characters)
summary: string (20-300 characters)
version: string (semver: x.y.z)
contentType: enum [markdown, code, data, media]
difficulty: enum [beginner, intermediate, advanced, expert]
```

### Recommended Fields

```yaml
taxonomy:
  subjects: array<string>          # High-level categories
  topics: array<string>            # ⚠️ MUST match folder depth (see below)
  subtopics: array<string>         # Even more specific narrowing
  concepts: array<object>
    - term: string
      weight: number (0-1)
      definition: string (optional)
  skills: array<object>
    - name: string
      level: enum [introduce, develop, master]

tags: array<string>               # ✓ Independent - NO hierarchy

# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# ⚠️  CRITICAL: Topics vs Tags
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# 
# TOPICS are HIERARCHICAL:
#   - Subfolders = subtopics of parent folder
#   - Topics MUST become MORE SPECIFIC as folder depth increases
#   - A file in /programming/python/async/ must have topics about async Python
#   - NOT broad topics like "web-development"
#
# TAGS are INDEPENDENT:
#   - No hierarchy, flat structure
#   - Can be shared across ANY folder level
#   - A deeply nested file can share tags with root files
#   - Example: both /python/async/coroutines.md and /overview.md can use
#     the tag "best-practices"
#
# See: openstrand-architecture.md#hierarchical-topic-structure-critical-rule
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## Validation Rules

### Automatic Validation

Run validation locally:

```bash
npm run validate
```

Or validate specific files:

```bash
npm run validate -- --files "weaves/tech/python/intro.md"
```

### Schema Compliance

**Required Field Validation:**
- All required fields must be present
- Fields must match expected types
- Enums must use valid values

**Content Quality:**
- Minimum 100 characters of content
- No placeholder text (test content, TODO, FIXME)
- No broken markdown syntax

**Unique Constraints:**
- `id` must be globally unique (UUID)
- `slug` must be unique within scope (loom or weave)
- No duplicate titles within same loom

### Quality Scoring

The auto-indexer assigns quality scores based on:

- **Completeness** (0-100): Percentage of recommended fields filled
- **Readability** (easy/moderate/difficult): Flesch-Kincaid analysis
- **SEO Score** (0-100): Title, summary, tags optimization
- **Confidence** (0-1): Categorization confidence

---

## Examples

### Minimal Valid Strand

```yaml
---
id: 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000
slug: hello-world
title: "Hello World"
summary: "A simple introduction"
version: "1.0.0"
contentType: markdown
difficulty: beginner
---

# Hello World

This is the minimal valid content.
```

### Comprehensive Strand

See [Full Example](#full-example) above for a complete, production-ready strand with all ECA fields.

### Simple Loom

```yaml
slug: quick-start
title: "Quick Start Guide"
summary: "Get started in 5 minutes"
ordering:
  type: sequential
  items: [install, configure, first-app]
```

### Simple Weave

```yaml
slug: tutorials
title: "Tutorials Collection"
description: "Step-by-step guides for common tasks"
looms: [quick-start, advanced-topics]
```

---

## Best Practices

### Metadata

1. **Be Specific**: Use precise, descriptive titles
2. **Be Consistent**: Follow existing vocabulary
3. **Be Complete**: Fill recommended fields when applicable
4. **Be Accurate**: Ensure difficulty matches content

### Content

1. **One Topic**: Each strand should cover one focused topic
2. **Self-Contained**: Strands should be understandable alone
3. **Well-Structured**: Use headings, lists, code blocks
4. **Examples**: Include practical examples
5. **Citations**: Link to sources and references

### Relationships

1. **Prerequisites**: List only direct prerequisites
2. **References**: Link to related, not duplicate content
3. **See Also**: External resources for deeper learning
4. **Avoid Cycles**: No circular prerequisite chains

---

## Validation Tools

### Local Validation

```bash
# Full validation
npm run validate

# Specific files
npm run validate -- --files "path/to/file.md"

# Check duplicates
npm run check-duplicates

# Generate template
npm run generate-template -- "My New Content"
```

### CI/CD Validation

All PRs automatically run:
- Schema validation
- Quality checks
- Duplicate detection
- NLP analysis
- AI enhancement (optional)

---
