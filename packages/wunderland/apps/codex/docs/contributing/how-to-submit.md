# How to Submit to Frame Codex

Welcome! This guide will walk you through the different ways to contribute knowledge to Frame Codex.

## Quick Start

The easiest way to submit content is through our **enhanced contribution modal** at [frame.dev/codex](https://frame.dev/codex):

1. Click the green **"Contribute"** button in the Codex viewer toolbar
2. Fill in your content (title, summary, markdown body)
3. Specify or leave blank weave/loom for AI suggestion
4. Add tags (or use suggested tags from content analysis)
5. Choose difficulty level (beginner/intermediate/advanced/expert)
6. Toggle AI enhancement (optional, explains cost vs free static NLP)
7. Preview final markdown with frontmatter
8. Click **"Create Pull Request"** (uses GitHub API if you provide PAT, or opens GitHub editor)

That's it! Our automated validation runs, and maintainers review your submission.

## Submission Methods

### Method 1: Web Submission UI (Recommended)

**Best for:** Quick submissions, beginners, anyone without Git expertise

The enhanced contribution modal provides:
- ✅ Pre-filled metadata based on current context
- ✅ Tag suggestions from content analysis
- ✅ Weave/loom inference (or manual override)
- ✅ AI enhancement toggle (optional, cost-transparent)
- ✅ Direct GitHub PR creation via API
- ✅ Fallback to GitHub web editor (no PAT required)
- ✅ Preview step showing final markdown
- ✅ No local setup required

**Steps:**

1. **Open Contribution Modal**
   - Go to [frame.dev/codex](https://frame.dev/codex)
   - Click the green "Contribute" button in the toolbar
   - Or use quick actions dropdown (mobile)

2. **Fill in Content**
   - **Title**: Clear, descriptive title (required)
   - **Summary**: 20-300 character abstract (required)
   - **Content**: Write or paste markdown (minimum 100 characters, required)

3. **Specify Location** (Optional - AI can suggest if left blank)
   - **Weave**: Which knowledge universe (e.g., technology, science, community)
   - **Loom**: Topic collection (e.g., programming, algorithms)
   - System auto-detects from current path or suggests based on content

4. **Add Metadata**
   - **Tags**: Type and press Enter, or click suggested tags from content analysis
   - **Difficulty**: Select beginner/intermediate/advanced/expert
   - **Subjects/Topics**: Auto-suggested from controlled vocabulary

5. **AI Enhancement** (Optional)
   - Toggle ON: AI analyzes content, suggests better categorization (~$0.01-0.20 cost)
   - Toggle OFF: Static NLP only (free, still provides quality validation)

6. **GitHub PAT** (Optional)
   - Provide token for direct API PR creation
   - Token is used only in your browser to call GitHub APIs directly and is never stored in localStorage, IndexedDB, SQL, or on any Frame.dev server
   - Leave blank to open GitHub web editor instead

7. **Preview & Submit**
   - Review generated markdown with frontmatter
   - See final file path: `weaves/{weave}/{loom}/{slug}.md`
   - Click "Create Pull Request"
     - Summary (extractive summarization)
     - Tags (TF-IDF keyword extraction)
     - Difficulty level (heuristic detection)
     - Subjects and topics (vocabulary matching)
   - Edit any field as needed

4. **Provide GitHub Token**
   - Create a [Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=repo&description=Frame%20Codex%20Submission) with `repo` scope
   - Paste it into the token field in the Frame Codex UI
   - The token lives only in that browser tab’s memory while the modal is open, is never persisted in local storage / IndexedDB / SQL, and is sent only to GitHub (never to any Frame.dev backend)

5. **Submit**
   - Click "Create Pull Request"
   - A new PR will be created on GitHub
   - You'll receive a link to track the review

**Rate Limits:**
- 5 submissions per hour per user
- Resets automatically after 60 minutes

---

### Method 2: GitHub Direct (Advanced)

**Best for:** Bulk submissions, complex content, experienced contributors

**Steps:**

1. **Fork the Repository**
   ```bash
   gh repo fork framersai/codex --clone
   cd codex
   ```

2. **Create a Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b add-my-content
   ```

3. **Add Your Content**
   - Place files directly within the target weave. Any folder becomes a loom, and any markdown file becomes a strand:
     ```
     weaves/
       [weave-name]/
         weave.yaml
         overview.md                 # Strand at weave root
         [loom-folder]/              # e.g. guides/, research/, notes/
           loom.yaml (optional)
           your-content.md
           nested/topic/advanced.md  # Nested looms are allowed
     ```
   - See [submission-schema.md](./submission-schema.md) for required metadata

4. **Validate Locally**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run validate
   npm run index -- --validate
   ```

5. **Commit and Push**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add [your content title]"
   git push origin add-my-content
   ```

6. **Create Pull Request**
   ```bash
   gh pr create --title "Add: [Your Content Title]" --body "Description of your contribution"
   ```

---

### Method 3: GitHub Web Interface (No CLI)

**Best for:** Single file submissions, quick edits

1. Navigate to [github.com/framersai/codex](https://github.com/framersai/codex)
2. Click "Add file" → "Create new file"
3. Enter the file path: `weaves/[weave]/[optional-folders]/your-file.md`
4. Add your content with frontmatter (see schema below)
5. Scroll down and select "Create a new branch for this commit"
6. Click "Propose new file"
7. Fill in the PR template and submit

# Introduction to Recursion in Programming

Recursion is a powerful programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller, similar subproblems.

## Key Concepts

### Base Case
Every recursive function must have a base case—a condition that stops the recursion...
