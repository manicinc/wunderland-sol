This strand condenses the OpenStrand Architecture into a short practitioner guide. For full details, see the comprehensive architecture document in the OpenStrand repo and related strands in this loom.

## Key Ideas
- Strands: atomic assets (docs, media, datasets); Looms: curated groups of strands (folders); Weaves: entire universes of content. No cross-weave edges.
- Ingestion: parse frontmatter → validate → persist ECA → index (text + vector) → construct relations (within weave).
- Retrieval: combine lexical + semantic + graph edges; re-rank with pedagogical and structural signals.
- Pipelines: support multi-format content; normalize to Markdown + frontmatter; attach assets alongside strands.

## Ingestion Mapping
1. Read `weave.yaml` → create workspace scope  
2. Detect looms: any folder inside a weave is a loom (no `looms/` prefix needed)
3. For each strand (markdown file):
   - Extract frontmatter (id, slug, title, taxonomy, relationships)
   - Store Markdown and assets
   - Create edges only to strands in the same weave
4. Build search index + embeddings

## RAG & Search
- Flat inverted index for fast client-side search (GitHub Pages).
- Vector store for semantic similarity (server-side or local).
- Graph traversal to suggest next-items within a loom.

## Governance & SEO
- Short executive summaries; single-topic strands; stable anchors; internal links between strands.
- Controlled vocabulary in `tags/index.yaml`; CI validates tag usage and relationships.
