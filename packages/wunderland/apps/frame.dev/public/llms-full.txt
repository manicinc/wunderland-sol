## Feature Deep Dive

### 1. AI-Powered Organization
Quarry automatically categorizes, tags, and links your notes using AI. Unlike manual tagging systems, it understands semantic meaning:
- Auto-generates relevant tags from content
- Suggests connections between related notes
- Creates smart summaries for quick review
- Extracts key concepts and entities

### 2. Knowledge Graph Visualization
Interactive graph view showing how your notes connect:
- Real-time visualization of note relationships
- Cluster detection for related topics
- Visual exploration of your knowledge base
- Export graph data as JSON

### 3. Semantic Search (~10ms)
Hybrid search combining vector embeddings with traditional search:
- Find notes by meaning, not just keywords
- Natural language queries ("What did I learn about React hooks?")
- Fuzzy matching for typos
- Filters by date, tags, folders

### 4. AI Q&A (Ask Your Notes)
Chat interface to query your knowledge base:
- Ask questions in natural language
- Get answers with source citations
- Multi-turn conversations
- Works with local LLMs or OpenAI API

### 5. 100% Offline-First Architecture
All data stored locally in IndexedDB:
- No internet required for core features
- No data sent to servers by default
- Works in airplane mode
- Full feature parity offline

### 6. Privacy & Security
- **Local-First**: Data never leaves your device unless you opt-in
- **E2E Encryption**: Optional cloud sync uses client-side encryption
- **Zero-Knowledge**: Even with sync, servers can't read your notes
- **Self-Hostable**: Run your own sync server
- **Open Source**: Audit the code yourself

### 7. Rich Editing
Full markdown support with extensions:
- LaTeX math rendering (KaTeX)
- Code syntax highlighting (100+ languages)
- Mermaid diagrams
- Tables, checklists, callouts
- Embeds (YouTube, Twitter, etc.)
- Custom CSS themes

### 8. Bidirectional Links
Wiki-style linking between notes:
- `[[Note Title]]` syntax
- Automatic backlink tracking
- Unlinked mention suggestions
- Graph visualization of connections

### 9. Spaced Repetition (FSRS)
Built-in flashcard system using FSRS algorithm:
- Create cards from highlights
- Optimized review scheduling
- Statistics and progress tracking
- Mobile-friendly review interface

### 10. Day Planner
Integrated planning and habit tracking:
- Daily/weekly/monthly views
- Habit tracking with streaks
- Task management
- Calendar integration (Google, iCal)

### 11. Themes (8 Built-in)
- Light
- Dark
