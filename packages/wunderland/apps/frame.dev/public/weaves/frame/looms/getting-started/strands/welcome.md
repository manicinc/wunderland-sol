# Welcome to Quarry

Quarry is your personal knowledge management system that weaves together your notes, documentation, and ideas into an interconnected fabric of knowledge.

## What Makes Quarry Different?

### 1. OpenStrand Architecture

Your knowledge is organized using the OpenStrand schema:

- **Weaves** - Top-level knowledge universes (like folders)
- **Looms** - Categories within weaves (subfolders)
- **Strands** - Individual documents (markdown files)

### 2. Plain Markdown Files

All your content is stored as standard markdown files on your local filesystem. This means:

- ✅ Edit with any text editor
- ✅ Version control with git
- ✅ Search with grep, ripgrep, or any tool
- ✅ AI agents can read and write directly

### 3. AI-Ready

Your knowledge base is designed to work with AI coding assistants:

- `llms.txt` provides instructions for AI agents
- `AGENTS.md` has detailed integration guides
- Standard file structure AI tools understand

## Quick Navigation

| Topic | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [Local Mode](./local-mode.md) | Setting up filesystem storage |
| [AI Integration](./ai-integration.md) | Working with AI assistants |

## Getting Started

1. **Choose your storage mode** in Settings → Content Source
2. **Set your weaves path** (where your files will live)
3. **Start creating strands** (documents)

Welcome to your knowledge fabric! 🧵
