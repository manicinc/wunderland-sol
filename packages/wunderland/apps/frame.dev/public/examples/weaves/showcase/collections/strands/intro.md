# Introduction to Collections

Collections are a powerful cross-cutting organizational layer in Frame. Unlike the hierarchical structure of weaves → looms → strands, collections let you group any strands together regardless of where they live.

## Why Collections?

- **Flexible grouping**: Add any strand from any weave to a collection
- **Project-based**: Group strands for a specific project or goal
- **Thematic**: Organize by theme across your entire knowledge base
- **Temporary**: Create ad-hoc collections for research or presentations

## Collection vs Loom

| Aspect | Loom | Collection |
|--------|------|------------|
| Structure | Hierarchical | Flat |
| Scope | Single weave | Cross-weave |
| Purpose | Topical grouping | Flexible grouping |
| Content | Contains strands | References strands |

## Getting Started

1. Go to the Collections tab
2. Click "Create Collection"
3. Name it and choose a cover pattern
4. Add strands from anywhere in your codex

> **Tip**: Use distinctive cover patterns for different types of collections—circuits for technical work, aurora for creative projects!
