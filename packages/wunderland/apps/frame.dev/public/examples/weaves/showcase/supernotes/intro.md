# Introduction to Supernotes

Supernotes are compact, structured notecards designed for **atomic note-taking** and **zettelkasten-style knowledge management**.

## What Makes Supernotes Special?

### 1. Atomic Notes
Each supernote captures **one idea, one concept, one thought**. This atomicity makes notes:
- Easy to find and reference
- Simple to link together
- Reusable across contexts

### 2. Required Supertags
Unlike regular strands, supernotes **require a supertag** that provides structure:
- `#task` for to-dos with status, priority, due dates
- `#idea` for raw thoughts and inspirations  
- `#book` for reading notes and highlights
- `#person` for contacts and people notes
- `#concept` for definitions and explanations

### 3. Visual Notecard Style
Supernotes display as **index cards** with:
- Paper texture background
- Corner fold effect
- Supertag badge
- Compact, scannable layout
