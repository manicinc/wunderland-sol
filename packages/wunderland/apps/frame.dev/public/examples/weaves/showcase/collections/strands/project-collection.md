# Project Collections Pattern

Collections shine when organizing everything related to a specific project, regardless of where individual strands live in your knowledge base.

## Example: Product Launch Collection

For a product launch, gather:

- **Specs** from `engineering/specs`
- **Designs** from `design/mockups`
- **Marketing copy** from `marketing/content`
- **Meeting notes** from `meetings/2024`
- **Research** from `research/user-interviews`

All accessible from one visual dashboard!

## Collection Organization Tips

### Color Coding by Status
- 🟣 **Violet**: Active projects
- 🔵 **Blue**: Planned/upcoming
- 🟢 **Green**: Completed
- 🟡 **Yellow**: On hold

### Pinning Strategy
Pin your top 3-5 active project collections for quick access.

### Cover Pattern by Type
- **Geometric**: Technical projects
- **Waves**: Creative projects
- **Topography**: Research projects
- **Mesh**: General/mixed projects
