# Voice-to-Canvas Capture

**Domain:** Product  
**Status:** Raw

## The Idea

What if you could speak your thoughts and have them automatically appear as connected nodes on an infinite canvas?

Imagine:
1. Speaking a stream of consciousness
2. AI detects discrete ideas
3. Each idea becomes a supernote
4. Relationships are inferred and visualized
5. Result: instant knowledge graph from voice

## Why This Matters

- Captures ideas at the speed of thought
- No friction between thinking and recording
- Preserves natural connections
- Works while walking, driving, showering
