# Emergence

**Domain:** Complex Systems  
**Difficulty:** Intermediate

## Definition

**Emergence** is the phenomenon where complex patterns, behaviors, or properties arise from the interaction of simpler components, without being explicitly programmed or designed.

The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.

## Examples

1. **Ant colonies** - Individual ants follow simple rules, but the colony exhibits intelligent behavior
2. **Consciousness** - Neurons fire, but consciousness emerges
3. **Markets** - Individual trades create complex market dynamics
4. **Language** - Simple sounds combine into infinite meaning

## Key Properties

- **Non-reducible** - Can't be predicted from components alone
- **Self-organizing** - No central control required
- **Scale-dependent** - Only visible at higher levels
