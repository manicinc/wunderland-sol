# Atomic Habits - Key Insight

**Book:** Atomic Habits  
**Author:** James Clear  
**Chapter:** 3  
**Rating:** ★★★★★

## The Quote

> "You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems."

## My Takeaway

Goals are about the results you want to achieve.  
Systems are about the processes that lead to those results.

The difference:
- **Goal:** "I want to lose 20 pounds"
- **System:** "I exercise 3x/week and prepare healthy meals"

Focus on building systems, not chasing goals.

## Application

This applies directly to:
- [[knowledge-management]] - build capture systems, not just consume
- [[coding-practice]] - daily practice over one-time sprints
- [[learning-system]] - spaced repetition over cramming
