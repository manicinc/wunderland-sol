Every strand begins with YAML frontmatter. Here's the complete schema:

## Basic Fields

```yaml
---
id: "uuid-or-slug"
title: "Strand title"
summary: "Strand-level extractive summary (one sentence)"
aiSummary: "AI-generated abstractive summary"
tags: ["schema", "reference"]
difficulty: "beginner"
taxonomy:
  subjects: ["knowledge"]
  topics: ["openstrand"]
relationships:
  prerequisites: ["weaves/openstrand/schema/hierarchy.md"]
  references: ["./related-strand.md"]
publishing:
  status: published
  lastUpdated: "2025-11-16"
---
```

## Block-Level Summaries

For paragraph-by-paragraph and block-by-block summaries:

```yaml
blockSummaries:
  - blockId: "block-0"
    blockType: paragraph   # paragraph | heading | code | list | blockquote | table
    startLine: 10
    endLine: 15
    extractive: "Key sentences from this paragraph..."
    abstractive: "AI-generated summary of this block..."
    notes: ["Important concept"]
    tags: ["core-concept"]
```

## Source Metadata (Provenance Tracking)

Track the origin of strands, distinguishing between **creator** (original author) and **uploader** (person who added to the system):

```yaml
source:
  # How the strand was created
  sourceType: manual      # manual | upload | scrape | template
  sourceUrl: "https://..."      # For scraped content
  sourceFilename: "doc.pdf"     # For uploaded files
  sourceTemplateId: "uuid"      # For template-based creation

  # Creator tracking (original author of the content)
  creator: "John Doe"           # Name of original author
  creatorType: git              # git | manual | session | scraped | unknown
  creatorVerified: true         # Whether identity was verified from metadata

  # Uploader tracking (person who added to system)
  uploader: "Jane Smith"        # Who uploaded this content
  uploaderType: git             # git | manual | session
  uploaderIsCreator: false      # True if uploader is also the creator

  # Scraped metadata (from source URL)
  scrapedAuthor: "Original Author"  # Author extracted from source
  scrapedSite: "example.com"        # Site/publisher name

  # Timestamps
  createdAt: "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z"
  uploadedAt: "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z"
  lastModified: "2025-01-16T14:00:00Z"
```

### Creator vs Uploader

- **Creator**: The original author who wrote/created the content
- **Uploader**: The person who uploaded the content to the system

For original content, `creator === uploader`. For scraped/uploaded content, creator may be "Unknown" until verified from source metadata.

### Creator Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `git` | Verified via GitHub authentication |
| `manual` | User manually entered their name |
| `session` | Tracked via browser session |
| `scraped` | Extracted from source metadata |
| `unknown` | Not yet verified |

### Connect GitHub for Verification

Users can connect their GitHub account to automatically:
- Set their GitHub username as the uploader identity
- Verify creator attribution for their own content
- Enable verified badges on authored strands

## Illustrations & Gallery

Attach images to specific blocks or the whole strand:

```yaml
illustrations:
  - src: "/images/diagram.svg"
    alt: "Architecture diagram"
    caption: "System overview"
    style: diagram        # diagram | sketch | infographic | chart | photo | icon | custom
    blockId: "block-3"    # Optional: associate with specific block
    aiGenerated: false
    width: full           # full | half | quarter | or number in pixels
    position: inline      # inline | float-left | float-right | margin

gallery:
  title: "Visual Examples"
  description: "Screenshots and diagrams"
  layout: grid           # grid | carousel | masonry | filmstrip
  columns: 3
  images:
    - src: "/img/example1.png"
      caption: "First example"
```

## SEO Controls

Control search engine indexing per-strand:

```yaml
seo:
  index: true             # Include in search engines (default: true)
  follow: true            # Follow outbound links (default: true)
  canonicalUrl: "https://custom-url.com/article"
  metaDescription: "Custom meta description for SEO"
  ogImage: "/images/custom-og.png"
  sitemapPriority: 0.8    # 0.0-1.0
  changeFrequency: weekly # always | hourly | daily | weekly | monthly | yearly | never

# Legacy (use seo.index instead)
noindex: false
```

## Notes

- `id` or `slug` helps external systems pin canonical references.
- `tags`, `subjects`, `topics` feed the Codex viewer's filters and search facets.
- `relationships` allows you to model prerequisites or "see also" references—these show up as backlinks.
- `publishing.status` can be `draft`, `published`, or `archived`. Draft strands remain readable but can be filtered out in search or UI toggles.
- `blockSummaries` can be auto-generated by the indexer or manually curated.
- `seo.index: false` excludes the strand from search engine crawling (adds `noindex` meta tag).
- `source` metadata tracks provenance and attribution—who created vs who uploaded the content.

Keep metadata minimal but intentional; the viewer already extracts file paths, names, and timestamps from GitHub.
