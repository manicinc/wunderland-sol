 * @file ToolPermissionManager.ts
 * @module backend/agentos/core/tools/permissions/ToolPermissionManager
 * @version 1.2.1
 *
 * @description
 * This module implements the `IToolPermissionManager` interface, providing a robust and
 * configurable system for managing permissions related to tool execution within the AgentOS ecosystem.
 * The `ToolPermissionManager` is a critical component for enforcing authorization policies,
 * evaluating requests against Persona capabilities, user subscription features (via `ISubscriptionService`),
 * and any other defined contextual rules. Its design emphasizes clarity, extensibility, and
 * adherence to SOTA TypeScript practices.
 *
 * Key Responsibilities:
 * - Initialization with a detailed configuration (`ToolPermissionManagerConfig`) and essential
 * dependent services such as `IAuthService` and `ISubscriptionService`.
 * - Authoritatively checking if a tool execution is permitted based on a comprehensive
 * `PermissionCheckContext`, which includes the tool in question, the invoking Persona's
 * profile, and the end-user's context.
 * - Verifying that the invoking Persona possesses all `requiredCapabilities` specified by the tool,
 * if `strictCapabilityChecking` is enabled.
 * - Interacting with the `ISubscriptionService` to determine if the user's current subscription
 * tier grants access to specific features that may be prerequisites for using certain tools.
 * - Providing clear, actionable reasons and detailed metadata for all permission decisions,
 * aiding in debugging, auditing, and user feedback.
 * - Centralizing tool access logic to enhance security and maintainability across the platform.
 * - Offering configurable logging for permission checks via `logToolCalls` in its configuration.
 *
 * Architectural Tenets Applied:
 * - Interface-Driven Design: Implements `IToolPermissionManager`.
 * - Dependency Injection: `IAuthService` and `ISubscriptionService` are injected.
 * - Comprehensive JSDoc: All public and significant private members are documented.
 * - Robust Error Handling: Uses standardized `GMIError` and `GMIErrorCode`.
 * - Configuration Management: Behavior is driven by `ToolPermissionManagerConfig`.
 * - Strict Type Safety: Leverages TypeScript's type system to prevent common errors.
 *
 * @see {@link ./IToolPermissionManager.ts} for the interface definition and related types (including `FeatureFlag` and `ToolPermissionManagerConfig`).
 * @see {@link ../ITool.ts} for `ITool` and `ToolDefinition` which include `requiredCapabilities`.
 * @see {@link ../../../cognitive_substrate/IGMI.ts} for `UserContext` definition.
