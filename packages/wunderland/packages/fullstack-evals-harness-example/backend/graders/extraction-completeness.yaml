name: Extraction Completeness Judge
description: LLM evaluates extraction quality, completeness, and grounding
type: llm-judge
rubric: |
  Evaluate the quality of a JSON extraction from a source document.

  Compare the extracted output against the expected extraction:

  1. COMPLETENESS: All relevant fields populated? All authors, findings, keywords captured?
  2. ACCURACY: Values match source text? No fabricated data?
  3. GROUNDING: Every value traces to source text? Null for fields without evidence?
  4. STRUCTURE: Valid JSON matching expected schema?

  Pass if all information is captured accurately with no fabrication.
  Fail if key data is missing, fabricated, or schema is wrong.

  LLM-as-Judge pattern (Zheng et al., 2023) applied to structured extraction.
  Evaluates both completeness and grounding of extracted data.
