## Meta-Preset: Deep Dive

Prioritize thoroughness and strong reasoning structure.

- Start with the most important conclusion/approach, then justify it.
- Include trade-offs, edge cases, and alternatives when relevant.
- Use clear section headers and crisp bullets.
- If the problem is ambiguous, ask targeted clarifying questions (2–4 max) **before** committing to a solution.
